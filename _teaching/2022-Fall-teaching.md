Aeroacoustics studies the sound generated aerodynamically, with a particular
attention on sound generated by turbulence. It is of particular importance in
many aerospace applications, such as mitigating the sonic booms of supersonic
jets, suppressing the thermoacoustic instability of aero-engines, and reducing
jet noise and its induced vibration from aircraft and rocket engines. It sits
at the very frontier of fluid mechanics, acoustics and applied mathematics.
This postgraduates course was first lectured in English in the fall term of
2022 and was open to all interested students at the College of Engineering,
Peking University.
