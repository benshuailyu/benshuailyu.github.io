## Motivation
Acoustic metamaterials is an increasingly popular field in recent years. These
materials are man-made structures that has been used in many areas of acoustic
research, such as environmental noise control and acoustic stealth. The
popularity lies in the fact that these metamaterials can manipulate sound in a
way that is often not possible in conventional materials. This opens the door
to use metamaterials in some novel applications where some extraordinary acoustic
properties are demanded.

## Background
Although being a relatively new research field, many types of metamaterials
have been proposed. Typical examples include sub-wavelength resonators, compact
sound absorbers and diffusers. Novel designs have the potential to address one
of the most pressing challenges in various sectors and relevant research has
therefore gained much attention in recent years. 

## Current research
Here in our group ongoing projects are of various dimensions. Our interests
range from the design, mathematical modelling and applications of metamaterials
in a number of different physical contexts. Together with mathematical analysis
and optimization, we use 3D printing for metamaterial manufacturing, and
acoustic experiments are conducted subsequently in anechoic chambers.
