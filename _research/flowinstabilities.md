## Background
The term instability predated the systematic study of flow instability, prior
to which it had been widely used to study the dynamic systems of particles and
rigid bodies described by Newton's or Lagrange's equations of motion. A system
is stable when, as Maxwell put,
> an infinitely small variation of the present state will alter only by an
> infinitely small quantity the state at some future time... But when an
> infinitely small variation in the present state may bring about a finite
> difference in the state of the system in a finite time, the condition of the
> system is said to be unstable.

Instability can also occur in flow systems, the study of which gave birth to
the subject of hydrodynamic instability. Some classic problems of hydrodynamic
stability were formulated in the nineteenth century, with notable contributions
from Kelvin, Helmholtz, Reynolds etc. The onset of instability is often the
prelude of flow transition from laminar to turbulent state, and hydrodynamic
stability has therefore become a subject under extensive research since its
emergence.

## Current research
Flow instability is an extensive research field. There exist many types of
instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Bernard, Taylor-Couette, and
Saffman-Taylor instabilities, to name a few. Here in our group we pay close
attention to the Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability of high-speed jets. Not only
because the instability waves can interact with the rigid surface in its close
proximity leading to various important new flow features, but also because its
role in generating jet noise remains inadequately understood. We are in the
meantime also interested in the instability of other types of flows such as
wakes and pipe flows of unusual geometry.
