We will present serrations of a novel shape!

A new **ogee type** serration is proposed to reduce leading- and trailing-edge noise. An asymptotic analysis is performed to identify the necessary mathematical conditions of the optimal serration shape. Based on the conclusions drawn we propose this new ogee type serration and conduct experiments to show that it is up to 8 dB more effective in reducing leading-edge noise.
