title: "Come to our talk at AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics 2022!"
---

Times flies - it's been almost three years since we attended the last AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics conference.

We are super excited to be able to share our latest research in this year's conference. We will be presenting a noise prediction model for rotating blades with trailing-edge serrations, a shock-instability wave interaction model and an analytical work on the Green's function for half-plane scattering by serrated edges.

Unfortunately because of Covid restrictions we will not be able to travel to Southampton to attend this conference in person. However, all our presentations have been recorded and will be played during the session according normal schedules! Come to our talk to learn more.
